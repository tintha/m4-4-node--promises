# The Call Stack

---

### Purpose of Node.JS

- Node is most often used to write web server code.
- Before Node, this used to be implemented in other _general purpose_ languages. (Python, Ruby, PHP, C++, etc.)

---

- Node was designed to be able to process many concurrent requests at the same time.
- This is done by running code in a single thread.
- It creates a separate thread for anything I/O.
  - read/write to disk
  - send/receive from the network
  - get user input from the keyboard

---

_The separate threads are completely inaccessible to JavaScript._

- It allows JS to process requests, and offload much of the data processing to other servers/databases.
- To do all of this, Node makes use of **the call stack**.

---

### the Call Stack

- When calling a function, JS suspends the currently running code and "jump" to the code of the function.
- When a `return` statement is encountered, JS needs to know where to _return_ to.
- JS keeps track of this in the call stack.

---

A stack is a data structure on which you can push items, and popping the stack will retrieve the last pushed item (LIFO, Last In, First Out)

---

```js
function firstFunction() {
  throw new Error("Stack Trace Error");
}
function secondFunction() {
  firstFunction();
}
function thirdFunction() {
  secondFunction();
}

thirdFunction();
```

---

JavaScript only has **one** call stack.

- Since the call stack uses up memory, you can sometimes get an error: `RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded`.
- This is expecially prevalent with recurcive functions.

```js
// Example
function callingMyself() {
  callingMyself();
}
callMyself();
```

---

### Blocking the call stack

Here is a typical request/response flow:

1. Receive an HTTP request from a client
2. Parse the HTTP request to understand it
3. Find out that the request is asking about the last 10 blog posts in our database
4. Make a request to the database (over the network)
5. **Wait** for the database response to come back
6. Parse the data and make it into an acceptable web format (HTML, JSON, XML)
7. Send the response to the client

_Where is there a potential problem?_

---

#### The Node solution

- Any I/O functions are made _asynchronous_
- Node uses a separate _thread_ under its control to do the I/O
- The I/O function will **not `return` anything**
- Instead, the I/O function will take an additional parameter, a callback.
- Node will register the callback function in its memory, and will call it back **later. When the database response comes back**.
- We say that Node will call the callback function **asynchronously**.

---

### The Asynchronous headache

- Since asynchronous functions return immediately, they don't have time to know if an error will occur.
- If any errors occur, they would be in the separate I/O thread which is under Node's control
- Among other things, this means that async errors can't bubble up the call stack because there is no call stack anymore when the data comes back

---

### Node solves this! (sort of)

- By convention, all async functions will accept a callback as their **last argument**
- Async functions will call the provided callback _only once_
- By convention, callbacks to async functions will always take an error parameter in the **first position**
- Any "result" or "success" parameters will go afterwards
- Callbacks to async functions must check if the error parameter is "set". Usually it will be an `Error` object, but anything truthy should be treated as an error
- Effectively this means that asynchronous code using callbacks has to manually bubble errors up the asynchronous call "stack".

---

This creates code such as the following:

```js
fs.readFile("file.json", function (err, val) {
  if (err) {
    console.error("unable to read file");
  } else {
    try {
      val = JSON.parse(val);
      console.log(val.success);
    } catch (e) {
      console.error("invalid json in file");
    }
  }
});
```

---

The previous code contains a mix of synchronous (`JSON.parse`) and asynchronous (`fs.readFile`) code, showing the two modes of operation:
`JSON.parse` `return`s its value synchronously. It can cause a `SyntaxError` when parsing its input, so we have to use `try`/`catch` to handle the error
`fs.readFile` does not `return` anything! Instead, it accepts a callback function. When the disk access is done, Node calls the callback function and passes it the data. But because an error could have happened, and `throw` can't be used (no more call stack to catch it), the callback accepts an `err` as its first parameter. The callback handles the error by printing "unable to read file"

---

This mix of code styles has some drawbacks:

- It is confusing because we can't easily know if a function is sync or async
- It forces us to manually bubble up errors
- It forces us to create awkward functions that have parameters that are not theirs -- `callback` for the async functions, and `err` for the callback
